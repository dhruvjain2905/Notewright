    Linear transformations are special functions that take vectors as inputs and produce vectors as outputs, moving them around in space in a structured way. What makes them 'linear' is that they preserve two fundamental properties: first, if you add two vectors and then transform the result, you get the same answer as transforming each vector separately and then adding them. Second, if you scale a vector by some number and then transform it, you get the same result as transforming first and then scaling. These properties might sound abstract, but they ensure that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced, and that the origin stays fixed—giving linear transformations their characteristic geometric structure.
